SoapUIScripts
=============

This project leverages the functionality of extensions in the free version of soapUI, in an effort to automate certain testing tasks. As with all Soap requests and responses, my project is aimed at creating a custom extension for my product to automate test cases with a combination of simple groovy scripts and extensions.
Currently, this project currently scans a small subset of the responses and based on certain validations extract URLs, essential information and saves them in a pre-decided folder. This is extremely helpful when creating huge test suites in SOAP UI and want a way to gather information from all the responses for later review. 
This project also introduces the ability to iterate in a test Suite. This can prove helpful if a test task needs to be repeated several times. Again, information from all the responses is stored for later review.
