SoapUIScripts
=============

This project is to create extensions to soapUI, in an effort to automate certain testing tasks.
For eg : Most of the requests that I work with returns responses with URL's in them. To make work easier, this project currently scans all the responses and then extracts the URLs, opens them and saves them in a separate folder.
